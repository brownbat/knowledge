## Find Composites Larger than $` n `$ That Are Not Factors of $` n! `$

1. Prime factorize $` n! `$ into $` 2^a \times 3^b \times 5^c \times \ldots `$
2. Find the smallest primes larger than $` n `$
3. Find the largest primes smaller than $` n `$
4. Build two categories of multiples:
    - **Category A**: Smallest primes above $` n `$ multiplied by 2, 3, etc.
    - **Category B**: Largest primes below $` n `$ raised to higher powers and multiplied by 1, 2, 3, etc.

### Example for $` 10! `$:

1. **Prime factorization of $` 10! `$**: 
   $` 10! = 2^8 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7 `$
2. **Smallest primes larger than 10**:
    - 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47
3. **Largest primes smaller than 10**:
    - 7 (considering higher powers like $` 7^2 = 49`$)
    - 5 ($` 5^3 = 125 `$)
4. **Build multiples up to some number (e.g., 50)**:

    - **Category A**:
        - $` 11 \times x = 22, 33, 44 `$
        - $` 13 \times x = 26, 39 `$
        - $` 17 \times 2 = 34 `$
        - $` 19 \times 2 = 38 `$
        - $` 23 \times 2 = 46 `$

    - **Category B**:
        - $` 7^2 = 49 `$
