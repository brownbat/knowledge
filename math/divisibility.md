# Divisibility Rules

Divisibility rules are shortcuts that help determine whether a given number is divisible by another number without performing full division. Here are the rules for some commonly used divisors:

## Divisibility by 2
A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).

## Divisibility by 3
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.

### Example
- Number: 123
- Sum of digits: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
- 6 is divisible by 3, so 123 is divisible by 3.

## Divisibility by 4
A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits form a number that is divisible by 4.

### Example
- Number: 1232
- Last two digits: 32
- 32 is divisible by 4, so 1232 is divisible by 4.

## Divisibility by 5
A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.

## Divisibility by 6
A number is divisible by 6 if it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

## Divisibility by 7
A number is divisible by 7 if you double the last digit and subtract it from the rest of the number, and the result is divisible by 7. This rule can be repeated as needed.

### Example
- Number: 203
- Double the last digit: 3 * 2 = 6
- Subtract from the rest of the number: 20 - 6 = 14
- 14 is divisible by 7, so 203 is divisible by 7.

## Divisibility by 8
A number is divisible by 8 if the last three digits form a number that is divisible by 8.

### Example
- Number: 12344
- Last three digits: 344
- 344 is divisible by 8, so 12344 is divisible by 8.

## Divisibility by 9
A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.

### Example
- Number: 162
- Sum of digits: 1 + 6 + 2 = 9
- 9 is divisible by 9, so 162 is divisible by 9.

## Divisibility by 10
A number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0.

## Divisibility by 11
A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions is either 0 or a multiple of 11.
You can alternately add and subtract digits from left to right. So for 14751, +1 -4 + 7 -5 +1 = 0, so it is divisible by 11.

### Example
- Number: 121
- Sum of digits in odd positions: 1 + 1 = 2
- Sum of digits in even positions: 2
- Difference: 2 - 2 = 0
- 0 is divisible by 11, so 121 is divisible by 11.

## Divisibility by 12
A number is divisible by 12 if it is divisible by both 3 and 4.

## Practice Problems

### Problem 1
Is 345 divisible by 3?

**Solution**: Sum of digits = 3 + 4 + 5 = 12. 12 is divisible by 3, so 345 is divisible by 3.

### Problem 2
Is 812 divisible by 4?

**Solution**: Last two digits = 12. 12 is divisible by 4, so 812 is divisible by 4.

### Problem 3
Is 987654 divisible by 7?

**Solution**:
1. Last digit: 4. Double it: 8.
2. Subtract from the rest: 98765 - 8 = 98757.
3. Repeat: Last digit: 7. Double it: 14.
4. Subtract from the rest: 9875 - 14 = 9861.
5. Repeat: Last digit: 1. Double it: 2.
6. Subtract from the rest: 986 - 2 = 984.
7. Repeat: Last digit: 4. Double it: 8.
8. Subtract from the rest: 98 - 8 = 90.
9. Repeat: Last digit: 0. Double it: 0.
10. Subtract from the rest: 9 - 0 = 9.

Since 9 is not divisible by 7, 987654 is not divisible by 7.

## Conclusion
Divisibility rules are handy tools to quickly determine whether a number is divisible by another without full division. By practicing these rules, you can improve your number sense and calculation efficiency.
