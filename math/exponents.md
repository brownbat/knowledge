# Exponent Rules

## General Principle for Combining Terms
When performing operations on the bases, use the operation one degree lower on the exponents.

### Multiplication (Product of Powers)

When multiplying bases, add the exponents.

$$
a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n}
$$

### Division (Quotient of Powers)

When dividing bases, subtract the exponents.

$$
\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}
$$

This can also be seen as a special case of multiplication.

$$
\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^m \times \frac{1}{a^n} = a^m \times \frac{a^0}{a^n} = a^m \times a^{-n} = a^{m-n}
$$


### Power of a Power

When raising a power to another power, multiply the exponents.

$$
(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}
$$

### Power of a Product

When raising a product to a power, distribute the exponent to each factor through multiplication.

$$
(ab)^n = a^n \times b^n
$$

### Power of a Quotient

When raising a quotient to a power, distribute the exponent to both the numerator and the denominator.

$$
\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}
$$

### Negative Exponent

$$
a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}
$$

A negative exponent indicates the reciprocal of the base raised to the positive exponent.

### Fractional Exponents (Roots)

$$
a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} = (\sqrt[n]{a})^m
$$

A fractional exponent represents a root. The denominator indicates the root, and the numerator indicates the power.

### Special Cases

Any non-zero base raised to the power of zero is 1.

$$
a^0 = 1
$$

Zero raised to any non-zero power is 0.

$$
0^n = 0 || n \neq 1
$$

Zero raised to the zeroth power is 1.

$$
0^0 = 1
$$

Sometimes left undefined in certain mathematical disciplines, but for most general cases defined as 1.

## Other Operations

Note if subtracting or adding bases, you cannot combine terms. 

Consider: 

$$ a^m + a^n || n < m $$

The best you can do is factor out the smaller term, leaving: 

$$a^n (a^{m-n} + 1)$$
