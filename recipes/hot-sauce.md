# Fermented Pineapple & Thai Pepper Hot Sauce

**Ingredients:**

- 600g Pineapple, for sweetness and tang
- 100g Thai Peppers, adjust based on heat preference
- 1 large Beefsteak Tomato, for body
- 150g Cucumber, for freshness (inspired by Yellowbird)
- 1 medium Onion, for depth
- 40g Carrot, for slight sweetness
- 30g Thai Basil, add at the end for freshness
- 5 cloves Garlic, lightly browned
- Juice of 4 Limes, for acidity
- 2.75% Salt of total weight (vegetables + water)
- Optional seasonings: Black Pepper, Cumin, or Turmeric
- Optional: A splash of Apple Cider Vinegar or White Vinegar for added tang and to adjust acidity

**Instructions:**

1. **Prepare the Brine**: Dissolve 2.75% salt of the total weight (including water) in enough water to cover all the vegetables in a large, non-reactive container. Ensure the salt is completely dissolved.

2. **Combine the Vegetables**: Chop the pineapple, tomato, cucumber, onion, carrot, and Thai peppers into uniform pieces. Add them to the brine. Reserve the Thai basil for later.

3. **Fermentation**:
    - Cover the container with a cloth or a fermentation lid to allow gases to escape but keep contaminants out.
    - Let the mixture ferment at room temperature, away from direct sunlight, for 2-3 weeks. Check periodically for signs of fermentation (bubbles, sour smell) and mold. If any mold appears, remove it immediately.

4. **Blend and Season**:
    - After fermentation, add the Thai basil and blend the mixture to your desired consistency. For a thinner sauce, you might separate some of the brine before blending.
    - In a pan, lightly brown the minced garlic cloves with a touch of olive oil, just until fragrant. Add optional seasonings (black pepper, cumin, or turmeric) to taste. Mix into the blended sauce.
    - Adjust the flavor with lime juice and a splash of vinegar if desired.

5. **Final Adjustments**:
    - Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning with more salt, sugar, or vinegar as needed.
    - If the sauce is too thick, adjust the consistency by adding back some of the reserved brine.

6. **Bottle and Store**:
    - Transfer the hot sauce into sterilized bottles. The sauce can be used immediately but will continue to develop flavor over time.
    - Store in the refrigerator to slow further fermentation. Use within a few months for best flavor.

**Notes:**

- Fermentation time can vary based on room temperature and desired level of fermentation. Taste periodically.
- The inclusion of cucumber and carrot is inspired by popular hot sauce brands and adds a unique flavor profile to the sauce.
- Adding the Thai basil at the end preserves its fresh, aromatic qualities.
- Lightly browning the garlic and optional spices enhances their flavors, adding complexity to the sauce.
