# Fried Rice Recipe

**Ingredients:**

- 4 cups day-old chicken rice
  - To prepare the rice, steam it with finely minced 1 tbsp ginger,
    5 cloves garlic, chicken fat or shredded chicken or stock, and
    0.5 tbsp sesame oil. Refrigerate overnight.
- 5 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 shallot, finely sliced (or 1/2 onion finely diced)
- 1 whole egg + 1 egg yolk, whisk together in a small bowl
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 0.5 tsp MSG
- 1 scallion, sliced
- Peanut oil for cooking

**Instructions:**

1. Coat a wok with peanut oil.
2. Heat over medium heat. Once smoking, pour the excess oil out of the pan.
3. Add garlic and shallot to the wok and fry for 3 minutes.
4. Add the egg mixture to the wok and stir until *almost* solid.
5. Add the cooked rice and mix everything together.
6. Add soy sauce and sesame oil around the rice, to the side of the wok so it gets some direct heat, then mix well, pressing the rice with the back of a spoon to absorb more flavors.
7. Sprinkle MSG and sliced scallion on top of the rice.
8. Mix well, cook only for one more minute, then serve.

**Bonus Tips:**

- Step 1: Consider adding pork or duck fat for extra flavor.
- Step 2: Add half of the scallion (white part), saving the green part for a late garnish.
- Step 6: Add white pepper for a bit more flavor.
- After Step 7: Serve with sambal balacan on the side

# Sambal Balacan Recipe

**Ingredients:**

- 10-15 fresh red chilies, deseeded and chopped
- 1 teaspoon of shrimp paste (balacan), toasted
- 3 shallots, peeled and sliced
- 1 clove garlic, peeled
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Juice of 1 lime

**Instructions:**

1. **Toast the Shrimp Paste**: Wrap the shrimp paste (balacan) in aluminum foil and toast it in a dry pan for about 1-2 minutes on each side, until it becomes fragrant. Be careful not to burn it.

2. **Prepare the Chilies**: If you prefer less heat, remove the seeds from the chilies. For a spicier sambal, leave some or all of the seeds in.

3. **Grinding Ingredients**: In a mortar and pestle or food processor, combine the toasted shrimp paste, chilies, shallots, and garlic. Grind or blend into a rough paste.

4. **Season**: Add sugar, salt, and lime juice to the chili mixture. Mix well. Taste and adjust seasoning according to preference.

5. **Serve or Store**: Sambal Balacan can be served immediately or stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

**Serving Suggestions:**

- Use as a condiment for fried rice, noodles, or grilled meats.
- Mix with steamed or boiled vegetables for a quick side dish.
- Spread on toast for a spicy breakfast kick.

**Notes:**

- Adjust the quantity of chilies based on your heat tolerance.
- Always toast the shrimp paste before using; it enhances its flavor and aroma.
