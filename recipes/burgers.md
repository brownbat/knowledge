# Seasoned Burgers

**Ingredients:**

- 1 lb or 450g of ground beef
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp pepper
- 1/8 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp onion powder
- Optional: 1/4 tsp old bay seasoning

**Instructions:**

1. Mix well, separate into fourths, roll into balls.
2. Preheat electric grill to 400째F. Grill for 3 minutes, turn, then grill for another 2 minutes. (Note: 6 minutes at 425째F may be too hot, aiming for an internal temperature around 145째F should allow for additional cooking while resting.)
3. Press down somewhat to flatten.

**Notes:**

- A lot of fat comes out during cooking; consider wiping it down for better crispy outsides.
- For smash burgers, consider dividing into eighths. If in eighths, 60g portions grilled at 400째F for 2 minutes per side may be okay, but could be slightly overdone and not crispy enough.
