# Homemade Chicken and Dumplings

Homemade chicken and dumplings recipe with broth and dumplings

## Ingredients

**For the Chicken and Broth:**
- 1 (3 to 4-pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces (or equivalent in chicken parts)
- 8 cups of water
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 onion, quartered
- 2 celery stalks, chopped
- 2 carrots, chopped
- 1 bay leaf
- 2 teaspoons fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)

**For the Dumplings:**
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons shortening or unsalted butter
- 3/4 cup buttermilk (or milk with a splash of vinegar as a substitute)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Broth:** In a large pot, combine the chicken pieces, water, salt, pepper, onion, celery, carrots, bay leaf, and thyme. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 1.5 to 2 hours, until the chicken is tender and falling off the bone.

2. **Remove the Chicken:** Take the chicken out of the pot and set aside to cool. Once cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones and shred it into bite-sized pieces. Discard the bones.

3. **Strain the Broth:** Strain the broth through a fine-mesh sieve, discarding the vegetables and bay leaf. Return the broth to the pot, add the shredded chicken back to the pot, and bring to a simmer.

4. **Make the Dumplings:** In a mixing bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Cut in the shortening or butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the buttermilk just until the dough comes together.

5. **Cook the Dumplings:** Drop tablespoon-sized pieces of dumpling dough into the simmering broth. Cover and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, until the dumplings are cooked through and the broth has thickened slightly.

6. **Serve:** Ladle the chicken, dumplings, and broth into bowls and serve warm.

## Notes

- You can add more vegetables to the broth if you likeâ€”peas and diced potatoes are popular additions.
- If the broth isn't thick enough for your liking, you can thicken it with a mixture of flour and water before adding the dumplings.
- For a richer broth, you can use chicken stock instead of water.

Enjoy this hearty and comforting bowl of homemade chicken and dumplings with your family on any cozy night in.

## Alternate Dumplings: Noodle Dumplings

### Ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 egg, beaten
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 4-6 tablespoons water or as needed to form a dough

### Instructions:

1. **Make the Dough**: In a large bowl, mix together the flour and salt. Add the beaten egg and mix. Gradually add water, a tablespoon at a time, until a stiff dough forms. 

2. **Roll Out the Dough**: On a floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/8-inch thickness. 

3. **Cut the Dumplings**: With a knife or pizza cutter, cut the dough into strips or squares, according to preference. 

4. **Cook the Dumplings**: Bring the chicken broth to a simmer. Drop the noodle dumplings into the simmering broth one at a time to prevent sticking. Cook for about 5-7 minutes, or until the dumplings are tender but still slightly chewy.

5. **Combine**: Once the noodle dumplings are cooked, continue with the main recipe as usual, combining them with the chicken and vegetables, and allowing everything to heat through together.

**Note**: Noodle dumplings can provide a hearty and satisfying texture to the dish, making it even more comforting. Feel free to adjust the size and shape of the dumplings to suit your preferences.
