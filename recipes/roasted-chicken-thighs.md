# Roasted Chicken Thighs with Root Vegetables

Tender and juicy chicken thighs with crispy skin, roasted over a bed of root vegetables.

## Ingredients

- 6 chicken thighs, skin on and bone in
- 1 lb (450g) potatoes, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1/2 lb (225g) carrots, peeled and sliced
- 1/2 lb (225g) parsnips, peeled and sliced (optional)
- 1 large onion, cut into wedges
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 tbsp olive oil, divided
- Seasoning: 1 tsp dried rosemary and 1 tsp dried thyme
- Alt: 2 tsp herbes de provence (basic recipe includes fennel, marjoram, rosemary, tarragon, and thyme. Other recipes include (or omit) basil, parsley, bay leaves, savory, chervil, sage, oregano, mint, and lavender)
- Alt: 2 tsp poultry seasoning (rosemary, oregano, sage, ginger, marjoram, thyme, and pepper, optionally nutmeg, sage, onion, garlic, rosemary, black pepper, ginger, Mediterranean thyme, parsley, marjoram, red bell peppers, ground coriander, allspice, Greek oregano, and savory.)
- Alt: 2 tsp Old Bay
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 425째F (220째C).

2. **Season the Chicken**: Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Rub them with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then season generously with salt, pepper, rosemary, and thyme. Set aside.

3. **Prepare the Vegetables**: In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, carrots, parsnips (if using), onion, and garlic. Toss with the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, and season with salt, pepper, and a bit more rosemary and thyme.

4. **Arrange the Pan**: Spread the vegetable mixture evenly in a large, oven-proof skillet or a roasting pan. Place the seasoned chicken thighs on top of the vegetables, skin side up.

5. **Roast**: Roast in the preheated oven for 35-45 minutes, or until the chicken skin is crispy and golden brown, and the vegetables are tender. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh should read 165째F (74째C).

6. **Serve**: Let the chicken rest for a few minutes before serving. Serve warm, with the roasted vegetables on the side.

## Notes

- Feel free to customize the root vegetables based on availability and preference. Sweet potatoes, turnips, and beets are also great options.
- Tomatoes, large cut bell peppers, brussels, mushrooms, leeks, butternut squash, or fennel might also work.
- For extra flavor, consider adding a splash of white wine or chicken broth to the vegetables before roasting.
- Fresh herbs like rosemary and thyme can be used instead of dried for a more vibrant flavor. Simply double the quantity if using fresh.

Enjoy this cozy and delicious one-pan meal with family and friends!
